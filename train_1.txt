Nondisplaced left occipital condylefracture. The left occipital condyle articulates normally withthe left lateral mass of C1.Temporal bone and skull base fractures are described in theconcurrenthead CT report. Nondisplaced fractures of the right first,second, and third ribs, with a small right apical pneumothorax.Biapical pulmonary contusions versus atelectasis.  Enlarged andheterogeneous thyroid gland with a 1-cm nodule in the left lobe.This may be evaluated by son[**Name (NI) 867**] when the patient is stable.CT torso ([**2197-7-23**]) - Right pneumothorax. Bilateralopacifications, likely aspiration, however, hemorrhage orcontusion cannot be excluded in the setting of trauma.Comminuted right scapular fracture, left lateral [**Doctor First Name 362**] scapularfracture. Left sacral fracture and superior ramus fracture. Leftclavicular fracture.Bilateral lower extremity XR ([**2197-7-23**]) - There is no evidence ofacute fracture or traumatic dislocation. There is no knee jointeffusion bilaterally.  No soft tissue calcifications orradiopaque foreign bodies are identified.Repeat CT head ([**2197-7-23**]) - Stable subdural hemorrhage along theleft convexity, right tentorium, and posterior falx.  Increasedconspicuity of bihemispheric subarachnoid hemorrhage. Increasednodular hemorrhage in left temporal region, which couldrepresent an evolving hemorrhagic contusion or nodularsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Multiple skull base and bilateraltemporal bone fractures are again noted.MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] ([**2197-7-23**]) - Bone marrow edema in the left occipitalcondyle at the site of known fracture.  No abnormalities in thecervical spine.MRA brain/neck ([**2197-7-23**]) - Technically limited neck MRA withoutevidence of obvious abnormalities. While evaluation fordissection or intramural hematoma is limited in the absence ofaxial T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, there is noirregularity in the carotid siphons to suggest an injury relatedto the bilateral sphenoid fractures.CT head ([**2197-7-24**]) - Stable subdural hemorrhage along the leftcerebral convexity and right tentorium with minimally decreasedhemorrhage along the posterior falx. Redistribution ofsubarachnoid hemorrhage with less conspicuity of bihemisphericsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Nodular hemorrhagic focus in lefttemporal region is relatively stable in appearance and sizecompared with most recent prior examination.  Multiple skullbase fractures and bilateral temporal bone fractures are againnoted.CT head ([**2197-7-25**]) - Stable small subdural hemorrhage and fewresidual small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stable lefttemporal hemorrhagic contusion with more prominent edema.CTA head/neck ([**2197-7-25**]) - Questionable small dissection flap inthe right cavernous carotid artery near the known sphenoidfracture, versus artifact. Aberrant right subclavian artery.EEG ([**2197-7-26**]) - This is an abnormal routine EEG due to thepresence of aslow background which represents a moderate encephalopathy. Itis alsoabnormal due to the presence of bursts of generalized deltafrequencyslowing which may represent deep midline dysfunction. There waslefthemisphere delta frequency slowing which represents focalsubcorticaldysfunction. There were no epileptiform discharges orelectrographicseizures.MR head ([**2197-7-27**]) - Hemorrhagic contusion in the left temporallobe. Several small foci of hemorrhage and diffusionabnormalities in the white matter suggest diffusion axonalinjury.  Shallow left-sided subdural fluid collection isslightly increased since the recent CT study.  Fluid and bloodin the bilateral mastoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses and theethmoid air cells from recent trauma.[**2197-8-3**] CT sinus' :There are soft tissue changes in the left sphenoid sinus, likelyrelated to trauma with blood products and small bony ossicles inthe floor of the sinus, which have slightly changed, but bettervisualized on the initial head CT of [**2197-7-23**].

Onadmission she was evaluated by Ortho Spine, Ortho Trauma andNeurosurgery.  CSF leakage was initially draining from her rightear but slowed down and per Neurosurgery required no treatment.Per Ortho Spine was she was kept in a hard collar.  Per OrthoTrauma her fractures were nonoperative and required slings.[**7-24**]:  Her propofol was weaned to off.  Her SBP was maintainedat less than 160 per Neurosurgery.[**7-25**]:  Her head CT and CTA's of her head and neck were repeatedand were normal.  Prophylactic heparin was started.[**7-26**]:  She was noted to have thick secretions and was bronched,and a BAL was sent.  Neurology was asked to see her for herfailure to wake up off sedation.  An EEG was obtained.[**7-27**] - [**7-30**]: An MRI was obtained which showed [**Doctor First Name **].  Her mentalstatus slowly improved and was noted to wax and wane.  Precedexwas utilized for agitation and her dilantin was discontinued.[**7-31**]: Ortho spine recommended c-collar for another 6-8 weeks.Neurology recommended a repeat EEG.  She remains on minimalventilator settings but is unable to extubate secondary tomental status.[**8-1**]:  Her WBC was noted to be rising so cultures were repeatedand a c.diff was ordered.Following transfer to the Surgical floor her WBC peaked at 23Kand all cultures were negative except for some sparse growth ofSA in a sputum culture without chest xray findings or symptoms.She remained afebrile off antibiotics and her WBC continued totrend down.  It was 15K at the time of discharge. She wastolerating her tube feedings at goal rate and was seen by theSpeech and Swallow therapist as her mental status improved.  Shewas inconsistent in her ability to follow commands and as shewas at such a high risk for silent aspiration she underwent avideo swallow on [**2197-8-8**] which indicated she was ready fortrials by mouth of thick liquids like honey given by teaspoon.Both the Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy servicesevaluated her on a daily basis and noted modest progression.Her attention span was gradually longer and she was beginning tosay a few words.  The Physical Therapist was limited inincreasing her mobilization as she was non weight bearing toboth upper extremities, required a hard cervical collar and shewas impulsive. Nevertheless she was out of bed and attemptinggait training. Her speech has improved immensely and she cangive coherent responses. She is moving all her extremeties withlimited movement of her R upper extremity.After an unfortunate accident she was transferred to rehab on[**2197-8-8**] for vigorous physical and cognitive therapy in the hopesthat she will get back to her baseline in time.Medications on Admission:OCPDischarge Medications:1. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times aday) as needed for constipation.2. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) ml PO BID (2times a day).3. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: 5000 (5000)units Injection TID (3 times a day).4. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: Twenty (20) ml POQ6H (every 6 hours).5. oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mls PO Q4H (every 4hours) as needed for pain.6. olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet,Rapid Dissolve PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation .Discharge Disposition:Extended CareFacility:[**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]Discharge Diagnosis:S/P Pedestrian struck1.

Four monthfollowup chest CTrecommended.4. Cardiomegaly with enlarged right atrium and dilated IVC andhepatic veins,which can be seen in right-sided heart failure.Brief Hospital Course:#.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was admitted andtransferred to the medicine floor.  Upon arrival he developedrespiratory distress in the setting of atrial fibrillation withRVR and IVF administration in the ED, likely causing fluidoverload in a patient with tenuous respiratory status atbaseline, h/o COPD and on home O2, with recent PE. The patienthad an ECHO, which showed an EF of 35%.  He was diuresed with IVLasix and showed improvement, O2 requirement decreased from 6LNCto 4LNC. Rate control was obtained with Digoxin (pt was loaded),Diltiazem, and Metoprolol. Diltiazem was subsequently stopped.Chest X ray showed bibasilar opacities and air-space opacitiesconsistent with atelectasis vs pneumonia.  He had a sputum whichonly showed mixed respiratory flora. LENIs were obtained andwere negative for DVT. The patient was subtherapeutic on hiscoumadin so a heparin bridge was briefly initiated until hebecame therapeutic. Cardiac enzymes were also obtained and werenegative x3 sets.  Once the patient stabilized he wastransferred back to the medicine floor where he continued torequire 2 to 4 L of oxygen.  As he was not on oxygen prior to[**Month (only) 958**], it was thought that he was in acute heart failure withpoor baseline reserve from his COPD, so he was aggressivelydiuresed with lasix. He remained 2 L negative per day for 5 dayswith only mild improvement in his oxygen requirement (low 80s onRA - 94% 4L).  Chest Ct was obtained and showed bilateralpleural effusions, stable severe emphasema, cardiomegally, and anew 7 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  It was thought thathis continued hypoxia was from acute CHF with a component ofrecent pulmonary events.  He was discharged on lasix 40 mg POdaily, spironolactone 12.5 mg daily and home O2.#.  Enterococcus Bacteremia:  The patient presented from rehabwith fevers.  He had a positive blood culture at the rehabcenter and had his PICC line removed (per report the tip wascultured and showed no growth).  His first set of blood culturesobtained at [**Hospital1 18**] was positive for Enterococcus, pan-sensitive.Because he had a recent positive VRE swab, he was empiricallytreated with Linezolid, but this was then changed to ampicillinafter cultures showed it was sensitive.  Surveillance culturesremained negative until [**2185-5-16**] when they showed one culturepositive for gram positive cocci.  A transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram were performed and showed novegetations.  The source of the patient's recurrent enterococcusbacteremia was further investigated, and GI was consulted todetermine if he was seeding his blood from a source in the gut.Because he had recently had a colonoscopy that was negative fora source (colon cancer), an MR enterography was performed toinvestigate the small bowel.  This study was also unrevealingfor a source of his bacteremia.  The patient will need tocontinue ampicillin for a total of four week course to end on[**2185-6-13**]  He will follow up with ID on [**2185-6-9**]. His PICC linewas not centrally located at discharge but after discussion withpharmacy and nursing it was concluded it could be still be usedas a midline for Ampicillin administration.#.  Atrial fibrillation: The patient presented with atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.  In the ICU he wasloaded with Digoxin and started on diltiazem in addition to hismetoprolol. He was rate controlled on this regimen with rates inthe 80s-90s.  Eventually the diltiazem was discontinued and heremained well controlled.  Coumadin was continued and he wasfound to have a subtheraputic INR during which time he wasbridged with heparin. His INR later became therapeutic andheparin was stopped. He should continue on the metoprolol,digoxin, and coumadin.#.  Hypertension: The patient was started on Dogoxin, anddiltiazem in addition to his home dose metoprolol as above forrate control.  His blood pressure remained in the SBP 100s-120son this regimen.  He was also started on lasix for his CHF.  Hisdiltiazem was discontinued and he was aggressively diuresed ashis blood pressure could tolerate. He was not started on an ACEinhibitor depite his low ejection fraction because he washeavily diuresed with lasix and his SBP remained 90's-110'safter he was re-started on his PO lasix dose.  He shouldcontinue to take 40 mg PO of lasix daily.  He should discusswith his PCP the need to start an ACE inhibitor due to his lowejection fraction.#.  Acute systolic CHF: The patient had an ECHO with EF 35%,similar to prior a study on [**4-2**]. It was thought that in thesetting of sepsis and IV fluid administration as well as a fibwith RVR, the patient had decompensation of his CHF. He diuresedwell to Lasix 20mg IV, and was negative 1 to 2 liters a dayduring the course of his admission.  His respiratory statusimproved, however he still required supplemental oxygen atdischarge.  He will need to continue his lasix and metoprolol.He was started on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily for mortalitybenefit and on simvastatin 20 mg daily. As above, he shouldeventually start an ACE inhibitor if his blood pressure cantolerate it. He was given an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] fromcardiology for outpatient follow up.# Urinary retention:  The patient had a foley placed in the ICUwhen he was being resuscitated.  After the foley was removed hefailed his voiding trial.  He was started on finasteride andtamsulosin and his urinary retention improved.  He will need tofollow up with urology.  He has an appointment on [**2185-7-13**].# CLL: The patient has known CLL.  His WBC count was elevatedbetween 13 and 19, which was lower than baseline.  There was noevidence of transformation.  He can continue his regular followup with oncology as an outpatient.# Pulmonary nodule: Seen on CT scan of the chest.  The patientshould have a follow up CT scan in four months.Medications on Admission:5% lidocaine patch to R ribs 6a-6p dailyAspirin 81 mg dailyoxycodone 5 mg po q6h prn paindiltiazem 60 mg po QIDKCl 20 mEq po dailyMultivitamin dailySpiriva 18 mcg inh [**Hospital1 **]Lopressor 100 mg po BIDPulmicort 90 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]Levalbuterol 0.63/3 ml q6hsennaLasix 40 mg po qamAtivan 0.5 mg po qhsRemeron 7.5 mg po qhs[**Name (NI) **] unclear dosing, ?4 mg daily, scheduled for 3 mg po thenight of admit which he did not receive.Discharge Medications:1.

You were found to have a blood infection with abacteria called ENTEROCOCCUS.  You were started on antibioticsfor this infection.  You had tests which showed that it was notcoming from your heart.  You also had an MRI which showed thatthere is no evidence of cancer in your gut that could havecaused this.  You will need to continue to take antibiotics byIV until [**2185-6-13**].  You will need to follow up as an outpatientwith the ID doctors (see below).You also developed an episode of shortness of breath while youwere in the hospital and had to be transferred to the ICU.  Itwas thought that your fast heart rate and CHF caused you to beshort of breath.  You were given medicines to take fluid off andyour breathing was better - although not back to your baselinefrom [**Month (only) 958**].  It was thought that your CHF and COPD werecontributing to your chronic shortness of breath.

The patient reportsgradual onset of his symptoms in the days leading up topresentation. He reports no baseline resting shortness of breathimmediately after recent discharge and only mild dyspnea onexertion. He denies associated fevers or chills, chest pain,cough, abdominal pain. He endorses stable lower extremity edemathat is symmetric in nature. No orthopnea or PND..Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from[**Date range (1) 106227**]. During that admission, the patient presented withnew-onset dyspnea, and was noted to have a pericardial effusionwith tamponade physiology. He was monitored in the CCU, thoughno pericardiocentesis was performed given its small size, andfollow-up ECHO revealed improvement in the effusion. Therpatient aslo had a new R-sided pleural effusion on CXR.Therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis performed, showingtransudative fluid, although flow cytometry of thefluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his knownlymphoma. His course was also complicated by new A.Fib with RVRthought [**3-14**] overdiuresis with high right sided pressures andpericardial effusion. He spontaneously converted back to sinusrhythm, and decision was made not to initiate anticoagulation..In the ED inital vitals were, 97.7 82 174/83 32 99% neb. EKG wasstable compared to prior. His exam was significant for JVD,diffuse crackles, 2+ lower extremity pitting edema from calvesto dorsum of feet. Bedside ECHO showed small pericardialeffusion, circumferential without tamponade physiology. Pulsuswas measured as 8mmHg. CXR was felt to demonstrate worseningpulmonary congestion and R-sided pleural effusion. Labs weresignificant for lactate 1.2, trop <0.01, BNP 4251 (unclearbaseline).

Borderline low QRS voltage in the limb leads.Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-1-31**] there is nodiagnostic change. Rate 83, QTc 442..[**2120-2-8**] TTE: There is mild regional left ventricular systolicdysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Theremaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). The rightventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wallcontractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate tosevere pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is amoderate pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographicsigns of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may beabsent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systoilc dysfunction,c/w CAD. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderatecircumferential pericardial effusion.Classic echocardiographic signs of tamponade are not seen,although echo evaluation of this physiology has a reducedsensitivity in presence of significant pulmonary hypertension..[**2120-2-8**] CXR (PORTABLE): Cardiomegaly is again seen,significantly increased since [**2116**], and appearing graduallyincreased since [**2120-1-23**] possibly reflectingpericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion and edemahave increased since the [**2120-1-30**], examination. Thereis an enlarged moderate right pleural effusion. A small leftpleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion andinterstitial edema, with enlarged moderate right pleuraleffusion. Possible pericardial effusion..[**2120-2-8**] CXR (PORTABLE): Moderately enlarged heart size fromknown pericardial effusion is similar. Moderate pulmonary edemahas improved; however, moderate right and mild left pleuraleffusion and bibasilar atelectasis are little changed.  There isno demonstrable pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours arestable..[**2120-2-9**] CXR (PORTABLE): Moderate cardiomegaly from knownpericardial effusion and mild bilateral pulmonary edemapersists, but improved since [**2120-2-8**]. Moderate right andminimal left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis isunchanged. There is no pneumothorax.

Pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.Moderate right pleural effusion is substantially smaller.Moderately severe right basal atelectasis and moderatecardiomegaly are stable. No pneumothorax.Brief Hospital Course:84 yo man h/o HTN, HL, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p fourweekly doses of Rituxan, recent admission forpericardial/pleural effusion who presents with dyspnea; CXRdemonstrating volume overload and worsening R-sided effusion, noe/o of tamponade physiology on bedside ECHO. Initially admittedto the ICU for hypoxemia, but improved with diuresis. Patientcontinued chemotherapy on the floor..ACTIVE ISSUES:#. Respiratory Distress: Etiology likely multifactorial,including worsening pulmonary congestion (known CHF w EF 45%)and R-sided pleural effusion (see below).  On presentation, didhave moderate sized pericardial effusion but no evidence oftamponade on ECHO or measured pulsus (8). Patient improved inICU with diuresis, which was continued on the floor.  He wastransitioned to room air..#. Pericardial effusion:  Moderate-sized, minimal change on echosince first seen on [**1-24**]. No echocardiographic signs oftamponade. No pericardiocentesis performed as was too small/highrisk. Pulsus was 8, within normal limits.  Unlikely to berelated to his shortness of breath.  Patient was monitored andremained hemodynamically stable..#. Right pleural effusion: On chest x-ray on admission, this wasnoted to be increased from prior. Transudative on lastdiagnostic tap ([**1-25**]). Believed to be [**3-14**] CHF, less likelymalignant. Cytology of pleural fluid revealed no malignantcells. However, flow cytometry of the fluid showed a minutepopulation of lymphocytes c/w his known lymphoma, unclear ifthis was simply contamination of the pleural fluid by traumatictap.  IP was consulted to assess possible drainage of effusion,however they felt it was not loculated and deferred the tap withplan to reassess.  After aggressive diuresis, repeat chest x-rayshowed improvement of pleural effusion..#. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: Disease appeared to be controlledafter 4 cycles of rituxan in [**Month (only) 116**], though concern that pleuraland pericardial effusions could be related to underlyingdisease. Rituxan was started [**2120-1-28**], complicated by atranfusion reaction with afib w RVR, hypotension.  Attempted togive another infusion of rituxan on [**2-8**], and per BMT recs,gave pre-treatment with benadryl, tylenol, and steroids.Unfortunately he had a severe reaction to the infusion, even atan extremely low rate (3cc/hr) this time with wheezing,tachypnea, hypertension and tachycardia.  After leaving the ICU,the patient received two doses of bendamustine, withoutincident.  After discharge from the hospital, he will follow upwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**].  He will continue bendamustine therapy.Treatment with rituxan will be attempted again at a slower rate. At the time of discharge, the patient had human anti-chimericand anti-murine antibodies sent out for testing to evaluate forallergy to rituxan.  Patient was also started on allopurinol 150mg PO daily for tumor lysis syndrome..#. Hypertension: Initially in 170s in ED, started on nitro gttprior to arrival in the ICU. He was restarted on captopril andmetoprolol and weaned of the nitro gtt.  He did continue to havesome hypertension, so captopril was up-tirated.  Blood pressurewas well-controlled after increase in captopril and diuresis...CHRONIC ISSUES:#. Atrial fibrillation: In sinus during this admission.Continued on his home metoprolol.#. Thrombocytopenia: Above recent baseline. Platelets weremonitored..#. Seizure Ppx: Sustained left temporal lobe caudate headhemorrhage and scattered acute subarachnoid hemorrhages after afall this year.  Continued on his home dose of levetiracetam 500mg PO BID.TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:# Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] on Tuesday, [**2-20**], [**2120**].  His office will be in touch about the time for thisappointment.  At that appointment, he will determine optimaltiming for the next dose of rituximab.# Human anti-murine antibody and human anti-chimeric antibodywere sent-out at the time of discharge.

Ofnote, she was hospitalized a year ago at [**Hospital3 3765**] forCOPD exacerbation, possible pneumonia, and possible heartfailure episode. CXR on [**10-23**] noted new left pleural effusionthat has persisted. She also noticed over the past 3-4 months inaddition to shortness of breath, anginal-type symptoms. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] had evaluated her in [**Month (only) 956**] and felt that she couldbe having ischemic symptoms and recommended cardiaccatheterization; however, there was concern about chronic kidneydisease and risk of dye load causing permanent renal damage.PFTs at the time were stable. She also has a small left pleuraleffusion that was unchanged. It was felt that her lung diseasewould not explain the degree of symptoms that she is currentlyhaving. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] (cardiology) was also concerned about hersymptoms. It was discussed whether or not she would want toproceed with a cardiac catheterization and risk of additional toher kidneys from contrastFor her symptoms, her shortness of breath occurs with almost anytype of activity and rapidly followed by severe discomfort inthe chest relieved by nitroglycerin especially with walking longdistances. With continued rest, her pain completely resolves.She is however able to ambulate around her living quarterswithout symptoms most of the time. She describes her symptoms ascentral non-radiating chest discomfort that is "frightening"with associated shortness of breath lasting minutes.  Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] had increased her metoprolol to 240 mg PO qD but thepatient is only taking metoprolol SR 150 mg PO qD. Herisosorbide had also been increased. Her last episode ofdiscomfort was the day prior to admission.After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33746**], it was planned to admit her tothe CCU for aspirin desensitization in setting of history ofaspirin-sensitive asthma and hydration prior to cath.She has been on warfarin for possible prior history of PE withlast dose on [**2149-3-28**].On the floor, patient is resting comfortably in bed with nocomplaints..On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or redstools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She deniesexertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review ofsystems were negative..Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope orpresyncope.

C. cath showed three vesseldisease, with critical Left main disease with evaluation forCABG deferred.# Aspirin-sensitive asthmaPatient reporting asthma attack 30 years ago from takingaspirin. She was admitted to CCU for aspirin desensitization insetting of aspirin-sensitive asthma per [**Hospital1 18**] AERD protocol. Herbaseline FEV1 was 61 % predicted. Her baseline peak flow was 250mL on admission. She tolerated the protocol with peak flow notdropping below 200 and symptoms such as wheezing, hives,dyspnea, rhinitis. She was subsequently continued on aspirin 325mg PO qD and should take this medication indefinitely. If sheshould stop aspirin for greater than 48 hours, the protocol mustbe repeated.# Coronary artery diseasePatient admitted for c. cath in setting of 6 month history ofincreasing dyspnea associated with central chest discomfortrelieved by rest and nitroglycerin. Patient has multiple cardiacrisk factors and CAD equivalent given PVD. She presents withseveral month history of increased frequency of anginal symptomsthat appears consistent with angina despite increased medicaltherapy.  No episodes of chest discomfort in hospital. No activesigns/symptoms to indicate acute ischemia including admissionECG similiar to prior. She underwent cardiac cath withpre-hydration/mucomyst showing three vessel coronary arterydisease (see c. cath report for full details). Cardiac surgeryevaluated patient and discussed high risk candidacy forrevascularization. The patient and her family discussed theoption and deferred surgery at this time.She was discharged on atorvastatin instead of home simvastatinin addition to plavix/aspirin. Her metoprolol succinate wasuptitrated from 150 to 200 mg PO qD.She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] (atrius cardiology).# PUMP:Patient has history of coronary artery disease.

There is persistent cardiomegaly with centralpulmonary vascular congestion and relative indistinctness of thehilum. Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted with fissuralfluid noted on the right. Mediastinal contour is grossly stableand difficult to accurately assess on this portable AP chestradiograph. No pneumothorax is seen. Bibasilar atelectasis isalso stable. Osseous structures are unchanged.IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.TTE [**2159-3-17**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. Leftventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricularcavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, afocal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overallleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Theright ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wallcontractility. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot bedetermined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aorticregurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitralregurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolichypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinicallyindicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination isrecommended to assess mitral valve morphology, exclude avegetation, and better evaluate severity of mitralregurgitation.IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with normal global systolicfunction.

He had no evidence ofnew ischemia by ECG or biomarkers. Diuresis with lasix IVboluses was initially limited by low BPs with SBPs in 70s-80sbut BP improved throughout hospital course as he was diuresedwith lasix gtt. He tolerated approximately 3L negative per dayand his renal function improved with diuresis. Lasix gtt wastransitioned to torsemide 80mg PO BID and metolazone with goal1L negative per 24 hr period. He bumped his creatinine on day ofdischarge from 1.7 to 2.3, so regimen was downtitrated totorsemide 60mg PO BID with no metolazone. He was also restartedon lisinopril 5mg PO daily for heart fialure and low dose beatblocker metoprolol 12.5 PO BID. He will continue on this foroutpatient regimen. His dry weight at time of discharge was 94kg on floor standing scale. He had been 92kg on CCU scale on dayprior to discharge. His admission weight was 106kg. His SBP was80s-90s at discharge which is likely his baseline.

Pulmonary - The patient has a longhistory of smoking and has been diagnosed with chronicobstructive pulmonary disease in the past.  On presentationshe was mildly tachypneic but sating at 96% on room air.  12hours later after receiving roughly 500 cc of fluid andmultiple nebulizers of Albuterol and Atrovent without relief,the patient suddenly became more tachypneic to 40 with 92saturations dropping to the low 90s on 4 liters.  Thisexacerbation of her respiratory decline was likely due to acombination of factors, 1.  Diastolic dysfunction andcongestive heart failure exacerbated by the frequentnebulizers of Albuterol, making her tachycardiac which hasgiven her likely diastolic dysfunction, causing exacerbationof congestive heart failure.  She was subsequently alsolikely to have exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease.  She was initially treated with Solu-Medrolintravenously, Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and CPAP andthen transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for furthermonitoring.  In the Intensive Care Unit she was seen to havechronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation andcongestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction.She was diuresed several liters of fluid.  She was intubatedbriefly for pulmonary aortic catheter placement but wasquickly extubated and slowly weaned from her CPAP.  Herrespiratory status gradually improved and on [**2-23**], afterdiuresis and continued treatment with p.o. Prednisone andAlbuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers she was sating93% on room air.  The patient has had pulmonary functiontests in the past but due to her mental status she was unableto fully cooperate with both tests.  It is unclear what herbaseline pulmonary function is.2.  Cardiovascular - The patient likely had an episode ofcongestive heart failure exacerbated by the tachycardia andchronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  In theIntensive Care Unit she had pulmonary artery catheter placedwhich demonstrated an elevated pulmonary capillary wedgepressure of 22 at peak and her cardiac output was 3.64 andcardiac index was roughly around 2.  She was diuresed severalliters of fluid with improvement in her cardiac output andher cardiac index.  She probably has baseline both systolicdysfunction given her low cardiac index and diastolicdysfunction, although the diastolic dysfunction was difficultto appreciate due to the limitation of the echocardiogram.The patient was ruled out for an myocardial infarction and aspreviously mentioned had a peak creatinine kinase of 340 anda peak troponin of .8 but this was likely due to hercongestive heart failure.  Subsequently upon transfer to thefloor, the patient was started on an ACE inhibitor which shetolerated well.  In addition, the patient had had episodes ofsinus tachycardia of unknown etiology and was treated withDiltiazem drip.  This was sort of in the place of herMetoprolol which had been discontinued considering thepatient had had episodes of bronchospasm in the past byreport while on beta blocker.  On the second day on thefloor, the patient tachycardia was well controlled in the low80s on Diltiazem 90 mg p.o. q.i.d.  Her blood pressure waswell controlled on ACE inhibitor, Diltiazem and the systolicpressures in the 110 to 140 range.  She appeared euvolemicand without evidence of congestive heart failure on [**2108-2-23**].3.  Infectious disease - The patient had been treated forbronchitis prior to admission.  Antibiotics were continuedfor two to three days after admission and then discontinuedas it seemed less likely that the patient had infection andmore likely chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseexacerbation/congestive heart failure.  She had a white countthat was elevated to 26 to 27.  The patient has chronicallyelevated white count which per the daughter has been workedup incidentally in the past.  This also probably represents aresponse to the steroids that she was given.4.  Neurological - The patient has baseline Alzheimer'sdementia, however, she was able to participate in adultdaycare actively.  During the hospital stay her dose ofSeroquel was increase as she had become somewhat agitated inthe Intensive Care Unit likely the result of her elevatedcarbon dioxide which was then blown off while on CPAP.  TheSeroquel was gradually titrated down to a dose of 12.5 b.i.d.though she remained somewhat lethargic on the day prior toadmission.5.  Endocrine - The patient has diabetes and hypothyroidism.She was continued on her Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q.d.  She hada mildly elevated TSH at 13 which may, however, be normal fora woman her age.  Her blood sugar remains somewhat difficultto control due to the steroids in the Intensive Care Unit.She was treated on insulin drip which was then changed toback to a standing dose of NPH 15 units in the morning, 10units in the evening and a modified insulin sliding scale ofregular insulin q.i.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehabilitation which will be specifiedlater.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:1.

Pulmonary:  Over the weekend the patient maintained her O2saturations and on the day of discharge was saturating 96% onroom air at rest.  Her wheezing had resolved and she was tobe continued on a slow prednisone taper for her chronicobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Her congestiveheart failure had resolved and there was no further need forthe Lasix, which was discontinued.2. GI:  The patient had slightly decreased p.o. intake theday prior to discharge.  This was deemed volitional.  Thepatient was seen by speech and swallow and determined thatshe was a very low risk for aspiration and that she was justdeclining to eat either likely secondary to her being in thehospital or because her daughter's weren't feeding her.  Theyfelt as though she would do well in rehabilitation as opposedto the hospital and with her daughters' assistance.  Thepatient continued to take liquids freely but was refusing toconsume significant solid food.3. Neurological:  The patient remained confused.

Came to the [**Hospital1 346**] to find her cervix was 4 cm with abulging bag with spontaneous rupture of membranes of clearfluid.  Decelerations shortly thereafter.  Infant wasdelivered by cesarean section.  The infant delivered inbreech presentation, was vigorous, responded nicely with bagmask ventilation, and subsequently intubation with a 2.5 ETtube.  Apgars were 6 and 8 at one and five minutes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Anterior fontanelle soft,flat.  Eyes appear normal by external examination.  Eyes,ears, nose, mouth appear within normal limits.  NECK:  Nomasses.  No adenopathy.  Clavicles normal to palpation.CHEST:  Breath sounds clear and equal bilaterally, slightlydiminished.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal heart sounds.  Nomurmur.  Perfusion good.  ABDOMEN: No masses.  Nohepatosplenomegaly.  Umbilical vessels 3 times.  GU:  Appearsas normal premature female.  Anus patent.  BACK ANDEXTREMITIES:  Skin with diffuse bruising of back, head,extremities.  NEURO:  Active.  Normal tone, strength for 27-week.HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1.  RESPIRATORY:  [**Known lastname **] was intubated in the delivery    room for management of respiratory distress syndrome.    She received a total of 1 dose of surfactant therapy.  On    day of life #2, presented with pulmonary hemorrhage    prompting transition to high-frequency ventilation.  She    later transitioned off, back to conventional ventilation.    On day of life #7, transitioned to CPAP.  She was    intubated on day of life #11 for increasing spells.  On    [**12-30**], the infant noted to have increasing needs for    suctioning and copious amounts of endotracheal    secretions.  A tracheal aspirate was sent and was positive    for staph aureus.  She was treated for 14 days with    oxacillin.  Attempted extubation on day of life #29    ([**2125-1-9**]).  Extubation attempt failed due to    increased work of breathing and stridor.  The infant was    given racemic epinephrine and steroids in the hope to    continue CPAP, but the infant continued to deteriorate -    prompting reintubation.  At that time, ORL from    [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted, and it was    recommended a rigid bronch once the infant reached 2    kilos.  The infant was maintained on minimal support of    16/5 with a rate of 14 in room air.  On [**2125-1-26**]    she self-extubated, but had to be immediately reintubated    due to stridor and increased work of breathing.

This is likely infectious or inflammatory(questionCrohn's) in etiology. Underlying [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] ischemia is felt lesslikely butnot completely excluded given lack of IV contrast on today'sexam. Increased adenopathy and fullness of the vasa rectasuggest active inflammation. 2. No findings of intra-abdominalabscess or bowel leak. No findings of obstruction with moderatesmall bowel ileus.CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2195-9-29**]: 1. Intervaldevelopment of a large amount of intraabdominal and intrapelvicfluid with enhancement of the peritoneum. These findings may beconsistent with peritonitis. 2. Interval development ofbilateral pleural effusions, moderate in size onthe right and moderate-to-large on the left with adjacentairspace collapse.  3. Continued wall thickening of the distalsmall bowel including the ileoileal anastomosis site and theileoanal pouch. These findings are likely infectious orinflammatory or could reflect hypoalbumimemia. There is partialsmall bowel obstruction with transition at the ileoilealanastomosis (likely from edema) also unchanged. 4. Smallnon-occlusive thrombus at the portal vein confluensCT ABDOMEN, PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2195-10-2**]: 1. Small amount ofhyperdense material in the right lower quadrant suspicious forextraluminal contrast material within the ascites. 2. Largeamount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fluid with enhancementof the peritoneum indicates peritonitis. The amount of fluid hasdecreased in comparison to prior study, likely having exited atthe former ostomy site as suggested clinically. 3. Bilateralpleural effusions, moderate in size on the right andmoderate-to-large on the left with adjacent atelectasis. 4.Heterogeneous mural enhancement with wall thickening of thesmall boweldistal to the ligament of Treitz to the pouch, worse in thepelvis, consistent with nonspecific inflammation. Pouch wallshows equivocal thickening.CTA CHEST W&W/O [**2195-10-19**]: 1. Substantial increase in large,nonhemorrhagic left pleural effusion since [**9-29**]. Nopleural mass, abscess or blood clot, and no appreciable pleuralinflammation. Atelectasis in the left upper lobe has worsened,left lower lobe collapse unchanged. 2.

In thecourse of her admission, consults were obtained from infectiousdisease, medicine, gastroenterology, acute pain service,interventional pulmonology, thoracic surgery and psychiatry.Neuro: The patient took po intake throughout the majority of heradmission though was made NPO intermittently, initially forobstructive symptoms and then subsequently for procedures.While NPO, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA withgood effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oralintake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.Adjunctive medications were also used for analgesia includingtylenol, flexeril and lidocaine topical patch.  Ambien was usedto treat insomnia prn.CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; shewas tachycardic to low 100s-110s at baseline.  Propranolol wasgiven on recommendation from psychiatry for anxiety.  Vitalsigns were routinely monitored.Pulmonary: The patient was noted to have bilateral pleuraleffusions L>R on CT scan [**2195-9-29**].  These were persistent onintermittent CXR's and CT scans [**10-19**] with the primarysymptomatic manifestation being L shoulder/chest wall pain andno manifestations of desaturation.  Interventional pulmonologywas consulted and a pleural drain was placed [**10-22**].  Uponrecommendation from thoracic surgery, TPA awas administered x 3days with significant output.  As the L lung remained unexpandedon serial CXRs, a second pleural drain was placed byinterventional pulmonology on [**10-26**] and TPA administered.  Givena lack of improvement of her L pneumothorax, the patient wastaken for VATS decortication by thoracic surgery on [**10-28**].  On[**11-1**], chest tubes were removed and post pull CXR showedpersistence of minimal L pneumothorax.  Plan was made forpatient to follow up with thoracic surgery in two weeks as anoutpatient following a CXR done on day of follow up appointment. Patient was otherwise stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vitalsigns were routinely monitored.GI/GU: Patient was admitted with obstructive symptoms ofdecreased ostomy output/abdominal pain [**9-17**].  Given that theremay have been a mechanical aspect to obstructive symptomsrelated to the loop ileostomy, patient was taken to the OR[**2195-9-18**] for ileostomy takedown.  Following this procedure,patient clinically deteriorated with tachycardia, severeabdominal pain and new onset abdominal distension.  Because ofher clinical distress and these new findings, she was takenurgently to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy andflexible sigmoidoscopy [**9-24**] where she was found to havesignificant ulcerations to the small bowel.  Continuedevaluation with radiological studies prompted by new entericdrainage through her previous ileostomy site revealed a new tinyperforation inthe small bowel in the right lower quadrant. The patient wastaken to the operating [****] for laparotomy, lysis ofadhesions, resection of portion of ileum with end ileostomy.Patient did well from a GI standpoint following this procedureand was advanced to regular diet.  Patient continued to haveintermittent episodes of small blood clots per rectum which willcontinue to be evaluated on an outpatient basis.Following resolution of her obstructive symptoms, patientintermittently tolerated regular diet though she was unable tosustain her caloric needs with po intake.  TPN was initiated on[**9-23**] and continued until [**10-27**] when calorie counts noted thatshe was taking in sufficient nutrition to sustain her recovery.Patient's bowel regimen was titrated with metamucil wafers andimmodium to an output of between 1 and 1.5 liters.Patient's RLQ previous ileostomy site was treated after takedownwith [**Month/Year (2) **] vac with favorable result.  Midline laparotomy [**Month/Year (2) **]healed well and at time of discharge an area of superficial skindehiscence had healed well.Patient required foley catheter for her operative procedureswhich was discontinued as appropriate postoperatively.  Herintake and output were closely monitored and she wasadministered IV fluids as appropriate.ID: Patient was given appropriate preoperative antibiotics forher operative procedures.Patient was noted to have an enteritis that was responsible forthe ulcerations of her small bowel.  She was initially startedon empiric antibiotic coverage for this with ciprofloxacin andflagyl.  Ultimately a diagnosis of CMV enteritis was made basedupon positive stains seen on pathology from resected anastomosis[**10-2**].  Patient was started on IV gancyclovir for CMV enteritisand responded well.  She completed a 24 day course of IVgancyclovir before being transitioned to a po prophylactic dosebased on recommendations from infectious disease.  Patient willmaintain this for three to six months time until her ileostomytakedown is complete.Heme: Patient was relatively anemic throughout admission andpatient was transfused as appropriate in setting of bleedingrelated to CMV enteritis.  Patient was last transfused [**10-11**] andremained stable thereafter.Of note, patient was found to have methemoglobinemia promptingadmission to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for hypoxia on [**9-23**].  This was likelyrelated to cetacaine spray received during EGD, as localanesthetic agents are one of the more common causes of acquiredmethemoglobinemia. Clinical suspicion of methemoglobinemia inthe setting of "cyanosis," in the presence of normal PaO2. Onlaboratory diagnosis, initial MetHb level 47. Patient treatedwith IV methylene blue with good response.Prophylaxis: Patient has history of DVT in [**8-14**] and had an IVCfilter in place at time of admission.  She received subcutaneousheparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up andambulate as early as possible.Psych: Patient was seen by psychiatry during this admission forfeelings of depressed mood and coping issues.  Per psychiatryshe was noted to have adjustmet disorder nos with anxiety andmedical comorbidities.  She was maintained on propranolol andativan per psychiatry for anxiety and remeron for depressivesymptoms.At the time of discharge on HD46, the patient was doing well,afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was wellcontrolled.Medications on Admission:Prednisone Taper, currently taking 20mg daily, due to bedecreased by 5mg on [**2195-9-19**].
