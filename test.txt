A/P: 58 y/o female with hx of DVT and menorrhagia s/p hysterectomy
admitted for epistaxis and c/p.
1-Epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blood
dyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis
( possible AVM ) vs longstanding HTN vs tumor. Pt had another episode
of nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding.
There was no need to tamponade pt's nares , however , in light of her hx
of menorrhagia , previous DVT/PE , and family hx of DVT's , it will be
important to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability in
this pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand's disorder , hemophilia ,
osler-weber-rendu d/o ). It will be also important to assess for possible
nasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). Coumadin was continued as pt has
high risk of forming DVT's. Her BP was also controlled with
HCTZ/triamterene and captopril to help control bleeding. Pt's BP dropped
significantly in response to Lopressor and HR's were down in the 40's ,
thus her Lopressor was held. Patient needed captopril for high BP , thus
will D/C on lisinopril 2.5. She needs to be followed up for compliance and
understanding of importance of BP control , as patient was not compliant on
medications on presentation , had very high BP on presentation.
2-chest pain: ACS vs PE vs GERD vs panic attacks. As pt has several
cardiac risk factors , her CE's were cycled and she was ruled out for MI.
An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% ,
no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have an
official DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk for
glucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as an
outpatient. Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipid
profile was obtained. It will be important that she take her statins
regularly. The pt had palpable cords and calf tenderness ( L&gt;R ) , so LENI's
were obtained prior to d/c and these were negative for DVT , although it
was a poor study due to her size. Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/p
may have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back and
right shoulder. Pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting before
the episodes , however. Pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and L
ribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. Finally , pt
seems to have a hx of anxiety , per herself and her daughters and as she
felt she was going to die and felt stressed during the nosebleeding , this
could have caused her c/p. Patient had a adenosine MIBI prior to discharge
and this was negative for any ischemic changes , and she was discharged to
home to follow-up with her PCP for further medical management of cardiac
risk factors.
3-Fibromyalgia: pt was asymptomatic , but we continued her home regimen
and pain control.
4-FEN: IVF were avoided given high BP on admission and K and Mag were
repleted as needed. She should continue a low choles/fat , and no salt
added diet.
FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your blood pressure was very high on admission but was easily controlled
with blood pressure medication. This was probably due to not using your
blood pressure medications regularly. It is crucial that you take your
blood pressure medications regularly as prescribed as uncontrolled high
blood pressure can lead to heart disease , kidney disease , and eye
disease. You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , low
fat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressure
or even lead to heart failure. You must also continue your coumadin
regularly as prescribed as you have a high risk of forming blood clots.
Please come to the ED if you have continued uncontrolled nose bleeds ,
severe uncontrollable headaches , fainting spells , chest pain , or
shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow-up HGBA1C , BP control , lipid panel , and chest pain with PCP as
an outpatient.
2. We recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as an
outpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.

71 y/o woman w/ hx of GERD , ?anginal pain , DM , HTN , asthma , DJD ,
gastroparesis admitted with two episodes of chest pain on the night PTA
relieved by nitroglycerin. Chest pain was burning , substernal and
resolved 5 minutes after taking NTG. No EKG changes in the ED. Has
had past admissions for chest pain but unable to decipher GI vs.
cardiac origin. Negative dobutamine echo in '98; no CAD as of '89
catheterization. Has an atrophic left kidney.

EKG: NSR , TWF V4-V6; LAE
***************************************
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Her nexium dose was increased and she was initiated on reglan. Although
she initially agreed to an ETT-MIBI ( refused dobutamine , avoiding
adenosine/persantine due to COPD/asthma ) , on the day of the procedure
she refused saying "there is nothing wrong with my heart". A similar
refusal occurred on a past admission. She is to be discharged w/ f/u
with Dr. Sheikh
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have any more chest pain please take a nitroglycerin. If the
pain does not go away call an ambulance. You may have heart disease
causing chest pain and so you will benefit from a stress test. Please
discuss with your doctor about scheduling this. Continue to take your
home medications. We have changed the dosing on the nexium and we have
added Reglan to help move food along.

Discharge Date: 8/15/2005
ATTENDING: PETROUITS , LEROY MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
An 86-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , hypertension , history of
recent CVA , presents with hypotension and shock , question of
sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient , as mentioned above an 86-year-old with history of
end-stage renal disease , insulin dependent diabetes , CAD status
post MI , bilateral above the knee amputations secondary to
peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular accident in 2/3 ,
who was initially admitted on 3/16/05 for nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis. Previously , the patient was admitted to Sourceshcate Naj. Hospital
for vertigo that was consistent with a right pontine lacunar
infarct , but despite being on Plavix and aspirin that was in
2/3 .  Her hospital course was complicated by an MI , and the
patient was medically managed. The patient was again admitted to
the Crny'ssha Medical Center on 3/2/05 for hypotension and unresponsiveness
after dialysis. She had negative CT at that point. Since that
admission , she had been doing well until 3/16/05 when she had
nausea vomiting and diaphoresis following hemodialysis. She was
admitted to rule out cardiac cause versus infection. Her
hospital course was complicated by continued hypotension and
decreased temperature. In the emergency department , on
presentation , the patient had a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate
of 102. Her blood pressure was 83 to 122 over 40s to 60s. Her
respiratory rate was 16. She was sating 95% on room air. She
got 500 mg of levofloxacin and her Lopressor was held due to
hypotension , and she was admitted with concern for infectious
process. She was initially admitted to the floor where she was
found to be afebrile with the rate of 92 , respirations of 20 , and
blood pressure was 100/57. Her exam revealed bibasilar rales ,
left greater than the right. Her abdominal exam revealed
nontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities revealed warm. She had bilateral below the knee
amputations. Her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and
rhythm with the 2/6 systolic murmur.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for chronic renal insufficiency , end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis , insulin-dependent diabetes , CVA ,
bilateral below the knee amputations , CAD , status post MI in
2/3 , hypertension , and peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:
Folate 1 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , NPH , Isordil , lisinopril ,
Plavix 75 mg , Paxil 10 mg , Pravachol 20 mg , Neurontin , Protonix
40 mg , vitamin B12 100 mcg , and Nephrocaps.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives with her grandchildren. She does not smoke or drink.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for sister with coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Neurologic exam: She is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA:
Significant for CK of 39 , MB of 2.3 , and troponin of 0.36. Her
white count was 8. Her hematocrit was 36.2 , and her platelets
were 298 , 000. Her INR was 1.3. Her EKG revealed a regular rate
and rhythm. Normal axis. T-wave inversions and flattenings in
the lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads. Her chest
x-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion.
IMPRESSION:
An 86-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , presenting with episodes of nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis of unclear etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient had a slight
troponin leak. It was unclear for initial presenting symptoms or
subsequent secondary to ischemia. On her second hospital day ,
she developed hypotension. Initially , her systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines were
held. Subsequently , her blood pressure dropped into the 70s and
she required dopamine and was transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit. In the Cardiac Care Unit , she was started on the dopamine
drip of 10 mcg/kg/minute. In the Cardiac Care Unit , the initial
differential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versus
septic physiology. However , her white count revealed significant
elevation of 24.6 with bandemia , 10% bands. She also had an
elevated lactate of 9.3 concerning for GI etiology. Possibly gut
ischemia was the cause of her infection. She was covered broadly
with amp , vanc , levo , and Flagyl. She subsequently required the
addition of Neo-Synephrine as a second pressor agent to maintain
her blood pressure. Dopamine was weaned off. However , on the
second day in the CCU , on 4/2/05 , the patient developed sudden
hypotension. Physicians were called to see the patient and at
that time she was found to have no palpable pulse. Code was
initiated. The patient was found to be in pulseless electrical
activity. Chest compressions were initiated , and she was mask
ventilated , and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine and
atropine. She received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp of
calcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the setting
of end-stage renal disease. Anesthesia then arrived and the
patient was intubated. Despite all efforts , the patient's rhythm
deteriorated to asystole , and she was pronounced dead at 5:30
p.m. on 4/2/05 , which was the time of death.

IMP: 60 yo woman with history of CAD and chronic pain syndrome , presenting
with 2 day history of chest pain and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV( I ): With history of CAD and symptoms consistent with new
ischemia , pt was admitted for ROMI. Ruled out with 3 sets of negative
cardiac biomarkers. Underwent myocardial perfusion PET-CT which showed
EF 58% with small area of scarring unchanged from previous study in 2004.
Continued home regimen of ASA , Labetalol , Candesartan , Lisinopril ,
Norvasc , and Plavix. Substituted Simvastatin for Lipitor.
2. CV( P ): On admission , pt appeared euvolemic on exam , with significant
hypertension , thought to be secondary to pain. Continued home
hypertensive regimen , as well as Lasix 40mg BID. Pt's
hypertension did improve with pain control. However , pt's creatinine
increased from 1.2 to 1.8 and pt appeared dry on 3rd day of admission.
Lasix was held and pt was given gentle IVF , which resolved ARF to Cr 1.3.
Pt has been instructed to hold her Lasix until Monday 1/19/07 , upon which
she will resume at 40mg daily. She will follow-up with her PCP next week to
assess need to adjust Lasix dosing.
3. CV( R ): Monitored on telemetry with no events.
4. GI: No active issues. Continued PPI.
5. PAIN: Continued home pain med regimen of Oxycontin 60mg q8h plus
oxycodone 5-10mg q4-6h prn for breakthrough. Pt continued to have
significant pain which presented in different locations. Most significant
was right breast/right underarm pain. Suspected etiology of this pain is
exacerbation of chronic pain syndrome vs musculoskeletal. Heating pads
offered some relief. Pt's pain was improved by discharge with no specific
intervention. Pt will follow-up with PCP to assess resolution of pain.
6. PSYCH: Pt has significant anxiety regarding lack of specific
diagnosis for her increased pain. Also expresses considerable amount
of anxiety/depression over life stressors ( son in Sterl Tuc Wau , recent death of
sister ). Suspect that anxiety/depression may be significantly contributing
to increased pain. Psychiatry was consulted who felt that pt was
expressing normal bereavement and that anti-depressant medication was
not indicated at this time. They recommended follow-up in the
Psychiatry outpatient clinic , for which the patient has been provided
a phone number to call. Pt felt significant improvement of anxiety
after talking to Psychiatry consult. Psych recommended Ativan prn for
anxiety , and pt was given prescription for Ativan 0.5 mg PO prn
for anxiety.
7. RENAL: Pt had ARF on day 3 with increased Cr 1.8 up from 1.3.
Likely dehydration as pt appeared clinically dry. Gave IVF and
held Lasix. Renal U/S was normal ruling out obstuctive etiology. With
hydration , pt creatinine normalized to 1.3 on day of discharge. Pt will hold
Lasix until Monday 1/19/07 , then resume at 40mg daily. Pt will follow-up
with PCP regarding adjusting Lasix dosing as needed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Allaway is a 52-year-old gentleman
who was initially admitted to Dutchesscanscot Medical Center due to nausea ,
myalgias and weakness. The patient has a history of type I
diabetes mellitus , end-stage renal disease with
subsequent renal transplant 11 years ago donated by his sister
for which he takes cyclosporine and azathioprine. The patient
had a neuropathic left plantar ulcer seven years ago for which he
underwent transmetatarsal amputation of his left foot at Reus Ortston University Of Medical Center . 
He has had a chronic recurrent ulcer of the left foot
over the last two years or so. The patient nonetheless was
reasonably doing well and very active. He recently did a 35-mile
bike ride in about four or five days prior to admission. He
developed nausea and vomiting which lasted for one day. He then
developed weakness and hyperglycemia. He tried to increase his
insulin , but found he did not have an adequate response. The
patient became more weak and was brought to the Copot Memorial Health Centers Emergency Department where he was found to have moderate
diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. The patient's workup also
suggested acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit. Echocardiogram was performed which revealed
an ejection fraction of 30% with dyskinesis of the inferior and
apical walls , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild left
atrial enlargement and intact interatrial septum , mild mitral
regurgitation , left atrium with history of thrombus ,
inferobasilar and inferoseptal akinesis consistent with old
inferoposterior myocardial infarction , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , trileaflet aortic valve , which is quite mobile
with no evidence for significant aortic insufficiency , normal
pulmonic valve and aortic atherosclerosis. No pericardial
effusion and no evidence of endocarditis. The patient developed
a fever the day of admission and blood cultures were drawn which
grew out Streptococcus morbillorum and Bacteroides. His foot
became clearly boggy and grossly infected with necrosis.
Within an hour of that he underwent guillotine amputation of his
left foot. His temperature normalized and his foot cultures grew
out Streptococcus mutans and E. coli as well as Bacteroides
fragilis. He received ampicillin and sulbactam for bacteremia on
10/28/06 .  He underwent a coronary cardiac catheterization and
was found to have the following , left main coronary artery with
an ostial 100% stenosis. Formal report is not available at this
time. The patient was then transferred to Johni Hospital for coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction ,
history of class II heart failure , hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , diabetic vasculopathy , renal failure and
nephropathy.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Kincer was brought to the operating room on
1/4/06 where he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass
graft x4 with a sequential graft from the saphenous vein graft
from aorta to the ramus and then the second obtuse marginal
coronary artery and left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery and a saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery. Total bypass time was 121
minutes. Total crossclamp time was 104 minutes. The patient did
well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident and was
brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in
stable condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. He was
extubated and transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #1. Infectious Disease Service was called and recommended
treating the patient with levofloxacin and Flagyl for total of 14
days for his left leg BKA site. The patient's chest tubes were
removed and post-pull chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.
Dr. Chang Eichberger from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted and
the patient was scheduled for revision of his left BKA on
5/15/06 .  Mr. Strathman was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55 year old right handed
woman with a history of diabetes on
Insulin for three years , hypertension , question of migraine
headaches for more than ten years , and question of benign
positional vertigo admitted with blurred vision , light headedness ,
and slurred and slowed speech since early the morning of
presentation and substernal chest pain times two weeks
intermittently. Patient had a greater than ten year history of
headaches , usually unilateral although alternating between left and
right , frontal and occipital , throbbing , and usually without visual
changes , possible migraine. Most recently , she has had the
headaches present for about three to four days and now has a left
sided frontal and occipital area headache. The morning of
presentation , she awoke and then when she tried to sit up , felt
light headed but without loss of consciousness. Then , when she
tried to talk , she noted slurred and slow speech although she
understood , had positive word-finding , no aphasia , no wheakness , no
numbness , or other sensory changes. Daughter called her Ton Hospital doctor and she was referred to Ren Care Health Emergency Room by ambulance. The patient has also been
complaining of substernal chest pain in the center of her chest ,
dull without radiation , intermittently times two weeks , usually
moderate in intensity , lasting about hours with no precipitating
factors noted , and occurred regardless of activity level , even at
rest associated with mild shortness of breath , no diaphoresis , and
no increased nausea or vomiting. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Also positive
for mild temperature rise around 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Of note ,
she does have a borderline personality and significant life
stressors of pressures about her job and death of her granddaughter
last year. In the Emergency Room , a head CT was negative for a
bleed , infarct , or mass lesion. She did have chest pain and had
received two sublingual Nitroglycerins without relief , Maalox with
some relief of that pain , and there were no EKG changes. The CK A
and B were flat. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus on oral
hypoglycemic times one year and then Insulin times three years
diagnosed as gestational diabetes at first approximately more then
twenty years ago. She also has a history of a hypertension ,
question of benign positional vertigo , cervical radiculopathy ,
bilateral carpal-tunnel syndrome , borderline personality with a
history of major depression , thalassemia trait , gastroesophageal
reflux disease , question of thyroid disease , chronic hepatic
abdominal liver function test rise with a possible biopsy in 5/24
although results are not here , and question of migraines since the
mid 1970s. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy and abdominal
hysterectomy. ALLERGIES: Doxycycline which causes mouth tingling ,
Penicillin which causes hives , Novacaine which causes hives , Diuril
which causes itching and nausea , Aldactone which causes hives , and
Aldomet which causes hives. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lasix 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , NPH Insulin 30 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Acebutolol 400
mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Valium p.r.n. SOCIAL HISTORY: No cigarettes
and no ethanol. She is a school teacher. FAMILY HISTORY:
Positive for a cerebrovascular accident in her mother at the age of
21 and no coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , she was an obese black woman
awake but very quiet and reserved but in no
apparent distress. Vital signs showed a temperature of 98 , pulse
78 , blood pressure 140/100 , and respiratory rate 18. Significant
positives included neurological examination of alert and oriented
times three , cranial nerves II-XII generally intact except for
right lower facial weakness with decreased nasolabial fold on the
right , motor was 5/5 in the left side upper extremity and lower
extremity , 5 minus deltoid on the right , and aside from that , 5
throughout , sensory examination was intact to light touch and pin
in upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally , and toes
were downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates and EKG
showed 79 , sinus rhythm , a first degree AV
block , left anterior hemi-block , a Q in III and F , and poor R wave
progression. Laboratory values showed a white count of 4.7 ,
hematocrit of 38 , platelet count of 181 , calcium was elevated at
11.5 with an albumin of 4.4 , phosphate was 3.1 , and alkaline
phosphatase 294.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for a rule out myocardial
infarction for the substernal chest pain although
there was a low index of suspicion for heart attack. She ruled out
by CK and had no EKG changes. PHC Cardiology felt that this chest
pain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it up
to the primary provider , Dr. Dorset , to arrange for an out-patient
exercise stress test if felt necessary. Most likely , the chest
pain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease and
the patient was restarted on Axid. Another issue was question of
new neurologic deficits although the original head CT showed no
evidence of stroke. The stroke may have been too early to detect
leaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident , a
manifestation of a seizure , or a conversion reaction secondary to
her borderline personality. Her primary deficit remained the
slowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without any
deficits in understanding or expression. A lumbar puncture was
done on the second day of hospitalization with a mildly elevated
protein in the sixties and a glucose in the 120 range. Cell count
was low not consistent with infection. A cardiac echo was also
done which showed normal left ventricular function without any
segmantal wall motion abnormalities , there was a question of left
ventricular hypertrophy , and carotid dopplers were done which
showed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries ,
however , there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque.
Patient's neurologic status remained stable during her
hospitalization. She was started on Aspirin on admission. After
much discussion with NMH Neurology as well as with Dr. Talboti , it
was felt that the patient could be followed as an out-patient. It
is recommended that the patient have Neurology follow-up next week ,
had a repeat CT of the head done to see whether ther is a new
infarct , and also an EEG was recommended by the Neurology
Consultation Servicer here for a question of seizures. Patient
will have home Occupational , Physical , and Speech Therapy provided
through Dishmution .  Another issue was hypercalcemia. Patient had an
elevated calcium on admission. Patient was guaiac negative without
any mass lesions. Patient's chest X-Ray was also read as clear
without any masses. Patient did have a cursory breast examination
without any evidence of a breast mass and has had mammograms in the
past without any evidence of malignancy. The etiology of the
elevated calcium was unclear although leading diagnoses include
primary hyperparathyroidism , prolonged immobilization , or lying in
bed with some leeching of calcium versus a possible malignancy.
Patient should have her calcium followed as an out-patient. She
did have a PTH level drawn during this admission , the results were
not back at the time of discharge , however , this level should be
checked upon her next visit. Patient is now ready for discharge
home.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PRESYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female
with coronary artery disease ,
status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery
bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into
the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a
racing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her
first myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in
1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her
LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to
her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery
bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable
since that time without angina or congestive heart failure
symptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance
test one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly
normal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing
heart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two
years ago.
On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,
nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until
the patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was
approximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with
this pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the
patient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of
the day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world
seemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes
until the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not
change in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness
of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,
trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying
racing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient
drove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Ward
for evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.
She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of
her review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft
in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has
had hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 1/29 showed
left ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral
hypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To
Penicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year
history of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink
alcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an
unemployed LPN , and has one child.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourished
black female very anxious and teary eyed.
Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95
in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at
98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin
was warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam
was benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous
distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The
lungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle
tenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular
rate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic
murmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was
diffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a
bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The
rest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits
were heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,
and her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her
hematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low
MCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed a
globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post
coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right
atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no
evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary
edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS
.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral
T-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The
patient had no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor , rule her out for an myocardial
infarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing
blood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in the
urine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive
regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac
monitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. The
results of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test
showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard
Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.
EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was
reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because
of this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the
outside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,
2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no
tumor or thrombus was detected.
Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein
of 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG
and IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and an
Aspirin a day. The patient was discharged to home in very stable
condition and will followup in REUM WILSHIP MEMORIAL HOSPITAL on 11/14/93 at 1:30. A copy of
this discharge should be sent to Dr. Mccrane , telephone number
778-8663 , who is her primary medical doctor. During her stay here ,
we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient's
status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Borge is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of
myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency
Department on 4/17/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion over the previous two months. The patient has known
coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and
balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch
of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his
posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of
his distal right coronary artery in 2005. While in the emergency
department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest
pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. He
received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKG
at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave
inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in
leads II , III and aVF. On 0/16/06 , he underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right
coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex
coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Right
dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive
stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal right
coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60
mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,
moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,
and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealed
right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left
internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. Pulmonary
function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 ,
35% predicted. Chest CT also performed on 6/21/06 revealed
cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve
and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular
density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left
lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural
thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,
recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and
small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction , class II angina with
slight limitation of ordinary activity , class III heart failure
with marked limitation of physical activity , status post a PTCA
atherectomy and stent placement , hypertension ,
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , gout ,
anemia , positive PPD , status post INH treatment , herniated disk ,
history bladder cancer , status post chemotherapy treatment ,
polysubstance abuse including ethanol and tobacco , narcotics , and
IV drug abuse. He is also status post a left thoracotomy for
pleural effusion 30 years ago , a hemorrhoidectomy , and bilateral
hand surgeries for contractures.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

PT/INR of 1.3 , PTT of 33.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Kreidler was brought to the operating room on 3/25/06 where
he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery. Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Total
crossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a
bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,
moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring
adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophageal
echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic
prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent
heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition. Please refer to dictation
number 5125348 for the immediate postoperative course. The
patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 9/28/06 .  The
patient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially
was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,
and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. The patient's mental
status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. Salser was placed on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Neurologically , he
remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to
Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day.
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.
