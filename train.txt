PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CALCIFIED AORTIC STENOSIS.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY IN 1989.
NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HYPERTENSION.
PSORIASIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old lady with
known history of coronary artery
disease , who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x three in
1989 , with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal , and
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. In the last
four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on 3/14/96 to Missi.ell Hospital where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
occluded.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. Micronase. Lasix
40 mg q. d. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.

Discharge Date: 4/2/2006
ATTENDING: COFFELL , TOMAS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was admitted for an elective right heart
catheterization and reassessment of refractory CHF and atrial fibrillation He
is a 62-year-old man with
a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30% who was diagnosed
about ten years ago and has been stable with medical management
until this past year when he started developing worsening dyspnea
on exertion , orthopnea , palpitations , and PND. His functional
status has declined significantly since then. In 7/26 , he was
admitted for decompensated heart failure and diuresed back to dry
weight. An ICD was placed at that time. Following discharge , he
developed AFib with rapid ventricular response and underwent DC
cardioversion with Dr. Gerry Canseco however , relapsed shortly ,
thereafter. He was started on amiodarone , but developed a
question of pulmonary toxicity with significant dry coughing. He
was continued to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response despite maximal carvedilol and digoxin. He is now being
electively admitted for right heart catheterization , diuresis ,
and possible repeat cardioversion versus amiodarone challenge ,
and completion of his transplant evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy , EF of 30% , atrial fibrillation status
post ICD placement , echo in 1/28 with an EF of 30-35% with a
dilated LV and anterior wall and septal hypokinesis , mild mitral
regurgitation , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Include aspirin 325 mg daily , carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. , digoxin
0.125 mg daily , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
daily , Vytorin 10 mg p.o. daily , Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Coumadin , iron sulfate 325 mg daily , and magnesium gluconate 500
mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
He has a questionable allergy to amiodarone.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Lives on Ence He does not drink , smoke , or use any other
drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 106 in atrial fibrillation.
His blood pressure is 102/78 and satting 98% on room air. He was
in no distress. His JVP was approximately 12 cm. He had a right
ventricular heave. His rate was irregularly irregular with an
S3 , no murmurs. Chest is clear to auscultation. He had a
palpable pulsatile liver tip , but otherwise , his abdomen was
benign. He had no lower extremity edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
He is a 62-year-old man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy , EF 30% ,
awaiting transplant who is now admitted for right heart
catheterization and diuresis for volume overload and possible
amiodarone challenge versus cardioversion , rate and rhythm
control atrial fibrillation.
Cardiovascular: The patient had no evidence of ischemia. He was
mildly volume overloaded and was gently diuresed with p.o. Lasix
and eventually b.i.d. p.o. torsemide at 60 mg b.i.d. He was
diuresed onto his dry weight of 70 kilograms. He underwent
exercise stress testing and was able to go for 7 minutes without
any ischemic changes. His rhythm rate was in atrial fibrillation
throughout. He has peak oxygen uptake with above is anaerobic
threshold and his peak respiratory exchange ratio was 1.44. He
underwent a chest CT , which showed no evidence of amiodarone
pneumonitis or interstitial disease , and then was subsequently
started on amiodarone challenge in attempts to rhythm and rate
control of atrial fibrillation. He was resistant to the
amiodarone in terms of rate and rhythm control; however , began
developing elevated LFTs consistent with amiodarone hepatitis as
well as a persistent dry cough concerning for amiodarone
pulmonary toxicity. The amiodarone was stopped and he was
started on dofetilide at 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. for correcting for
his creatinine clearance. After 2 doses of dofetilide , he
converted to normal sinus rhythm and was rate controlled in the
70s and 80s. His QTc was followed twice a day and did not show
any signs of prolongation. He was finally being discharged on
dofetilide for rate and rhythm control as he is now in normal
sinus rhythm. He will also go home on torsemide 60 mg p.o.
b.i.d. to maintain his dry weight. He has been instructed to
continue taking his glyburide , but not his metformin given his
poor creatinine clearance being discharged with a creatinine of
1.6 and the fact that he is on metformin. He will see his
primary care doctor and will either likely be started on low-dose
insulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent. He will follow up
with his primary care doctor and Dr. Rosasco for continued
transplant evaluation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Include carvedilol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , darbepoetin 100 mcg
subcutaneous q. week , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. every other day ,
dofetilide 125 mcg p.o. b.i.d. , Vytorin one tab p.o. daily , iron
sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , potassium
40 mEq p.o. daily , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Protonix 40 mg
p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
q.p.m.
FINAL ADDENDUM:
The patient will continue taking his Coumadin for goal INR of 2-3
and follow up at the Vent Buffbo Medical Center Coumadin Clinic , in addition , he
received one unit of packed red blood cells for anemia of chronic
disease and was given IV iron therapy and will continue the
patient on oral iron replacement.

ATTENDING: BRADLEY ZENI MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath , hematuria.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with
a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from Longlate General Medical Center on 3/28
and subsequently transferred to Ieu University Medical Center The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have "crackles" at the rehab , and was
sent to the Ridwill Child for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile with a heart rate
of 82 , blood pressure 132/72 , respiratory rate 94% on room air ,
weight 420 lbs. General: Morbidly obese , speaking in full
sentences. HEENT: Oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. Neck:
JVP less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary to
habitus. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , no
S3 or S4 appreciated. Lungs: Increased crackles at the bases.
Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.
Extremities: Lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. Skin:
The patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patient
reports they have been improving over the past year ) , and the
patient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legs
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3.
Motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on 8/18/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on 3/24/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
8/18/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in 10/14 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On 8/4/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/14/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On 6/11 the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 0/2 At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.

Discharge Date: 11/25/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: A 29-year-old G 3 P 2 admitted on postoperative
day #19 , status post a STAT cesarean section at
29 weeks for fetal bradycardia following laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. She was readmitted for wound infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's past medical history
is significant for cardiac transplant
in 1989 for a dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient is on multiple
immunosuppressants. The patient had several episodes of acute
cholecystitis and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy nineteen
days prior to admission. Fetal bradycardia developed immediately
following the cholecystectomy and a STAT cesarean section was
performed. The patient was returned to the Cardiology Service for
further management of fluid status and mild congestive heart failure.
She was discharged on postoperative day #7. On 6/28 the patient
was seen in the MFM practice and a wound hematoma on the left side was
noted. It was and drained with normal , healthy tissue identified.
She had b.i.d. dressing changes with a visiting nurse. On the day of
admission the patient noted a temperature to 100.0 , slightly foul-smelling
discharge from the wound. She denied abdominal pain. The patient
also noted that the right foot pain present at the time of surgery
had been worsening over the course of the day and was noted to be
swollen and erythematous at the time of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Viral cardiomyopathy , now status post
transplant , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.8 ,
hyperlipidemia , obesity , history of group A Strep sepsis in 1998.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2 in 1998 and 2001 ,
laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 4/13 ,
D&amp;E for SAb in 21 of June , status post eye surgery in 1973.
MEDICATIONS: Imuran 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.; cyclosporin 125 mg p.o.
q.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.; pravastatin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; quinidine sulfate 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Kaopectate 30

p.r.n.; Tylenol #3 1-2 p.o. q. 4-6h p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , penicillin , IVP dye all cause pink rash ,
succinylcholine resulted in respiratory arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 ,
blood pressure 120/60 ,
respirations 18 , pulse 74. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
nontender , nondistended , incision was open at two sites. There was
gray , malodorous fluid draining from the wound. The wound tracked
superiorly on the left. The fascia was intact. There was no
evidence of necrotic tissue. EXTREMITIES: Distal extremities had
trace edema , right greater than left with erythema and tenderness
on the dorsal surface of the right ankle.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Wound infection: An Infectious Disease
consult was obtained at the time of admission and
the patient was sent for immediate intraoperative treatment and
wound debridement. Surgery was consulted intraoperatively to
confirm healthy tissue and no evidence of necrosis. The patient
was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin IV and t.i.d. dressing
changes. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic therapy were
negative for bacteremia. Cultures of the wound were consistent
with Strep and diphtheroids with obvious polymicrobial involvement.
On hospital day #3 blood cultures which had been drawn from the
patient's indwelling line returned with 2/4 bottles positive for
gram-positive cocci in clusters. The central line was discontinued.
The patient began treatment on vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12h , levofloxacin
was continued and the Flagyl was started 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. The
patient remained afebrile throughout this time. A CT of the abdomen
and pelvis was obtained per Infectious Disease recommendation and it
confirmed that there was no intraabdominal abscess. The patient was
continued on IV vancomycin with p.o. Flagyl and levofloxacin until
8/21/01 , hospital day #8. At that point the patient was discharged to
home with visiting nurse and continued IV and p.o. antibiotics x 14
days. Cultures obtained following discontinuation of her central
line returned as negative. On hospital day #6 the patient had
a significant yeast infection surrounding the lower aspect of the
incision as well as in the intertriginous areas. This was treated
with topical nystatin.
2 ) Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiac standpoint remained
stable throughout the admission with no evidence of congestive
heart failure. Routine echo was performed on 1/15/01 as scheduled
per her transplant protocol. There were no other cardiovascular
issues during the patient's admission.
3 ) Renal: The patient had a baseline history of renal
insufficiency as described above with a creatinine of 2.1 on
admission. Creatinine increased during her admission to a maximum
of 3.1. She was also noted to have decreasing urine output at that
time. Adjustments were made in vancomycin and cyclosporin levels
and the patient's creatinine slowly returned to baseline with
significant improvement of urine output.
4 ) GI: The patient had no difficulties with bowel function until
hospital day #5 when patient was noting increasingly loose
stools. C. diff. was obtained x 2 and were negative. She was
treated with Imodium p.r.n.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient had initially right ankle pain and
swelling noted at the time of admission. A Rheumatology consult
was obtained and the joint was tapped and there was no evidence of
infection at that time. The patient was continued to be followed
by Rheumatology and , based on Rheumatology and Transplant Team
recommendations , was treated with colchicine for the diagnosis of
gout on immunosuppressant medications. The possibility of plantar
fasciitis was raised during admission and treatment was pain
medication , continued colchicine and physical therapy. The patient
was able to ambulate at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin 750 mg IV q. 12h; levofloxacin
500 mg p.o. q.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
x 14 days; Percocet 1-2 p.o. q. 3-4h p.r.n. pain.
The patient had a visiting nurse established for continued b.i.d.
dressing changes at home and to obtain vancomycin and cyclosporin
levels as needed.
FOLLOWUP: She will be followed by her cardiac transplant team to
follow her antibiotic and immunosuppressant levels. She
was scheduled for routine follow up with the cardiac transplant
team with no changes in appointment time , follow up with OB/GYN in
two weeks' time.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted to the Foundtah Medical Center surgery service after undergoing
LRYGB. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated
operative note for details. Patient was transferred to the floor from
the PACU in stable condition. Patient had adequate pain control and no
issues overnight into POD1. The patient had an UGI on POD1 and 2 that
were
negative for obstruction or leak but did not show contrast past the
pouch. She did vommit POD 1 , but was able to tolerate the contrast on
POD2. Her lack of empting thought secondary to edema at surgical site and
it resolved by POD 3. The patient was then started on stage I gastric
bypass diet and advanced the following day to a Stage II diet that was
tolerated as well. JP draion removed POD 6. The remainder of the
hospital course was relatively unremarkable , and the pateint was
discharged in stable condition , ambulating and voiding independently , and
with adequate pain control. At discharge the incision was C/D/I , with no
evidence of hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given
explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. Jaffray in 1-2 weeks.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You may shower 2 days after surgery , but do not tub bathe , swim , soak , or
scrub incision for 2 weeks. Bandage strips will fall off over time.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient is a 80 y/o female with hx of CAD , DM , HTN , left PICA stroke
who presented to the ED after a fall. SHe was admitted after being
found to be demented and unclear if this was a new or old diagnosis.
Basic labs for dementia were sent including TSH , B12 , folate which were
normal. MRI revealed a mennigioma and old PICA infarct. LIkely
diagnosis is Alzheimer's Disease. She was started on Aricept and
Seroquel. PT/OT evaluated her and felt that she was safe to be d/c home
with services. SW was consulted to arrange for this. Her family was
contacted and expressed concern for her safety at home. Patient was
resistent to home care and did not feel that she needs any help in the
home. Psychiatry was consulted to determine if she has the capacity to
make decisions regarding her care. They did feel that she has
diminished capacity but felt that she would be safe to return to her
home. She was d/c home with services.

palatal petechiae. Pupils are equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation. There is no scleral icterus present.
Neck: Supple. There is no lymphadenopathy or masses present.
Cardiovascular: Rate is irregularly irregular. It is
bradycardic. There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border that is heard throughout. Jugular
venous pressure is distended and can be seen at the level of the
ear. Respiratory: There are bilateral basilar crackles.
Abdomen: Obese. There are positive bowel sounds. Abdomen is

are 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient is alert and oriented x3 and
exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium
4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , BUN 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,
anion gap is 8. White blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,

STUDIES AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION.
1. Chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and CABG.
There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which is
unchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is a
small left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced in
size compared to his previous x-ray dated 7/11/07 . 
2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , a
right bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which
is unchanged from an EKG in 0/17 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with a history of multiple medical problems most significantly
including recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD
status post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with
a fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with
concerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was
initially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.
Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out
two out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.
Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000
colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken
from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,
few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood
cultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient's
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on
5/8/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The
patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any
significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have
remained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative
for any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's high
risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also
negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The
patient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high
risk.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or
chest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG
and was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also
continued on statin.
Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission
and was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he
appeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then
gradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV
Lasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the
time of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but
diuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was held
in the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation
of gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is
96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should
continue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight is
approximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.
Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the
mid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused
permanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be
avoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes
were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium
above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated
given his bradycardia.
2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion
for endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have
Gemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above
empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to
gentamicin and ceftriaxone on 5/8/07 once gram-positive cocci
were speciated. The patient was initially treated for
pseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that
only 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime
could be discontinued and that there would be some response to
ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 5/8/07
for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a
full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week
course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite
both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram
given his high risk for endocarditis.
3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix
and all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The
patient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units
nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.
5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline
of 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely
be due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was
diuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of
discharge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan
was held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.
6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of
admission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 0/24
due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was
clamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL
and the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,
so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled
without difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile
dry dressing to be changed daily.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a
current input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid
restriction.
Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily
electrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his
potassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of
Lasix daily. This should be continued.
Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium
diet and a 2 L fluid restriction.
8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and
albuterol.
9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for
iron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild
eosinophilia , which should be followed.
10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his
right hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and
sterile dry dressing changes daily.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin
5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.
CODE: The patient is full code.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Vital Signs:
temperature 98.7 , blood pressure is 118-140/60-70 , heart rate
35-58 , respiratory rate 18-20 , oxygen saturation 94-100% on room

CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient has an EF of 35%. When last examined in
2003 , on presentation , was volume overloaded. However , BP was
well controlled. Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and then
converted to an oral regimen. Blood pressure was titrated as
well as heart rate for improved rate control. ACE inhibitor was
initially held in the setting of worsening renal function ,
however , restarted prior to discharge. A repeat echo on 10/7
revealed an EF of 35% with an akinetic septal and inferior wall;
hypokinetic anterior lateral and posterior wall as well as left

the right atrial pressure similar to the prior study in 2003.
Ischemia , patient also has a history notable for coronary artery
disease status post CABG. Although the patient denied ongoing
chest pain , given history of diabetes , we were concerned for
ongoing ischemia. However , enzymes were negative x 3 with
telemetry notable for multiple runs of NSVT , stretching 20 to 30
beats , concerning for ongoing ischemia. Patient underwent
cardiac cath on 4/27 , which was notable for a left main 70%
stenosed and LAD 100% stenosed , circumflex 90% stenosed , RCA 100%
stenosed , large one 100% stenosed with an intact LIMA to LAD

Rotablator and balloon to the left circumflex and the OM lesions
and the LAD , left circumflex , and OM were stented. Patient was
continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. Patient was
started on Plavix. Patient was instructed to remain on Plavix
until further notice. Patient has baseline AFib with runs of
NSVT , which improved significantly status post revascularization.
Rate control was improved with a regimen of beta-blocker and
amiodarone. Patient will be continued to be monitored on
telemetry.
PULMONARY: Patient oxygenated well throughout her hospital stay.
Patient was carefully diuresed in the setting of acute on
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a dye load. On
discharge , she is oxygenating well on room air.
HEME: Hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course.
Coumadin was initially discontinued to proceed with cardiac
cath; however , patient was restarted on Coumadin with PCP
followup to follow INR. At the time of discharge , the patient has
mild thrombocytopenia. PCP will continue to monitor.
ENDOCRINE: Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , on
insulin , was continued during her hospital stay , increased her
Lantus dose secondary to suboptimal blood sugar control.

control. Patient also has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH
within normal limits and she was continued on her current dose of
Levoxyl.
RENAL: Patient has acute on chronic renal failure , baseline
creatinine of 1.4 to 1.6 , likely secondary to poor forward flow.
Creatinine improved with diuresis. At the time of discharge ,
creatinine was in the range of 1.8. Currently , she will be
continued to be followed as an outpatient. Patient will be
started back on ACE inhibitor prior to discharge. Prior to
cardiac cath , the patient did receive bicarb and Mucomyst to aid
in renal protection. At p.m. , patient was maintained on a
cardiac food-restricted diet.
NEURO , OPHTHO: Status post cardiac cath , patient complained of
left blurry vision. Patient was evaluated by neurology and
ophthalmology , which revealed a left corneal abrasion. They
recommended no further imaging studies , however , one may consider
carotid ultrasound as an outpatient to further evaluate.
